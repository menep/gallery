# CSS Very Scottish Gallery

## Motivation

I've wanted to create a gallery to display some of my photos for a while, so here it is! It has been build with CSS Grid.

## Project status

The grid and the carousel are complete.
There are some issues to fix (JS refactor, using arrows for navigation, only clicking esc allows to return to the gallery from the overlay, correct visualization of vertical images).

## How to use

Hovering over an image shows its color version, clicking on it open an overlay to see it in a bigger size. Clicking on the arrows allows you to navigate the photos.

## Practiced features

- CSS Grid

## Setup

yarn install

## How to run

yarn start

## Screenshots

## Known issues

Vertical images are not correctly visualized in the overlay.
JS code is currently messy.

## Images

All photos were taken by me.

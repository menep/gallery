# CSS Very Scottish Gallery

![alt text](./screenshots/home.jpeg?raw=true)

## Motivation

I've wanted to create a gallery to display some of my photos for a while, so here it is! It has been build with CSS Grid.

## Project status

The grid and the carousel are complete.
There are some issues to fix (JS refactor, only clicking esc allows to return to the gallery from the overlay).

## How to use

Hovering over an image shows its color version, clicking on it open an overlay to see it in a bigger size. You can navigate the photos clicking on the UI or the keyboard arrows.

## Practiced features

- CSS Grid

## Setup

yarn install

## How to run

yarn start

## Known issues

JS files need to be refactored.

## Images

All photos were taken by me.

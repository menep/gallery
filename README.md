# CSS Very Scottish Gallery

![alt text](./screenshots/home.jpeg?raw=true)

## Motivation

I've wanted to create a gallery to display some of my photos for a while, so here it is! It has been build with CSS Grid.

## Project status

Basic functionality is working (photo display and carousel).
More photos will be added and maybe the grid will be randomized. Performance issues will be addressed too (remove exif, images are too heavy, will probably experiment with sprites).
I might eventually create a NodeJS server with a database and an api with info about the photos.

## How to use

Hovering over an image shows its color version, clicking on it open an overlay to see it in a bigger size. You can navigate the photos clicking on the UI or the keyboard arrows.

## Practiced features

- CSS Grid
- Webpack configuration from scratch

## Setup

yarn install

## How to run

yarn start

## Known issues

Images are too heavy, Sass/JS are not tidy.

## Images

All photos were taken by me.

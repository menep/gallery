# CSS Very Scottish Gallery

![alt text](./screenshots/home.jpeg?raw=true)

## Motivation

I've wanted to create a gallery to display some of my photos for a while, so here it is! It has been build with CSS Grid and vanilla JS.

## Project status

Basic functionality is working (photo display, carousel, responsive grid).


## How to use

Hovering over an image shows its color version, clicking on it open an overlay to see it in a bigger size. You can navigate the photos clicking on the UI or the keyboard arrows.

## Practiced features

- CSS Grid
- Webpack configuration from scratch

## Setup

yarn install

## How to run

yarn start

## Known issues and future features

Images are too heavy, Sass/JS are not tidy.
The grid randomization functionality might be a feature in the future.
Performance issues will be addressed too (remove exif, images are too heavy, will probably experiment with sprites, lazy loading).
I might eventually create a NodeJS server with a database and an api with info about the photos.

## Images

All photos were taken by me.
